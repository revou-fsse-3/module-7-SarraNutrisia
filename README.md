Python is a high-level programming language commonly used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and many other applications. It is known for its clean syntax and ease of understanding, as well as its great flexibility. Flask is one of the popular web frameworks for Python. It is designed to create web applications quickly and easily, with a focus on simplicity and flexibility. Flask does not require many external tools or libraries, making it suitable for small to medium-sized projects. Poetry is a dependency management tool for Python projects. It allows you to define your project's dependencies in a pyproject.toml file and manage their installation, updates, and configuration consistently. Poetry is often used in modern Python application development due to its intuitive abilities and seamless integration with other tools in the Python ecosystem. This week, I have Connecting A Flask Application to A MySQL Database and Implementing Basic CRUD.
